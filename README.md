# Project Kotlin

This is a personal project that I am learning and building using the Kotlin programming language. The goal of this project is to enhance my Kotlin programming skills and explore new concepts in mobile application development or other programs using Kotlin.

## Project Goals

- Learn and apply Kotlin features in real-world projects.
- Build a practical project to improve programming skills.
- Practice object-oriented programming, functional programming, and software design principles.

## Technologies Used

- Kotlin: The primary programming language for the project.
- Android SDK: If the project is an Android application.
- Other libraries and frameworks (if any), such as Retrofit, Ktor, or other supporting libraries.

## Setup

1. Clone the project to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/duynghiadev/project-kotlin.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd project-kotlin
    ```

3. Install dependencies (if any) using Gradle:
    ```bash
    ./gradlew build
    ```

## Running the Project

- If it’s an Android application:
    1. Open the project in Android Studio.
    2. Run the app on a real device or emulator.

- If it’s a non-Android Kotlin application:
    1. Use IntelliJ IDEA or any IDE that supports Kotlin.
    2. Run the application from the IDE.

## Next Steps

- Add new features.
- Improve and optimize the codebase.
- Learn more advanced Kotlin concepts and apply them to this project.
